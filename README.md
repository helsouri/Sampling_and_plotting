# Sampling_and_plotting
The purpose of this assignment is to create a function called the damped sinu-soid, which is given by: y = eaxcos(wx) <br>
Also, we will make a plot of a real world function based on underlying function rather than a mathematical formula. <br> <br>
Available is the pdf file along with the tex file alng with entire zip file <br> <br>
_c code file is missing after losing files due to laptop migration but pdf contains all the code_ <br> <br>
**Code needs openFramworks to function properly**
